# Movie Analysis on basis of Genre

The CMPT 353 Data Science course culminates with this assignment. The goal is to use the storyline synopsis to gauge a film's popularity and level of success. Predicting movie genres from movie descriptions and examining the trends in movie genres over time make up the two primary components of the data analysis procedure. This makes it possible to categorise a film's genres and compare them to the prevailing trends to determine whether the recognised genres are in demand.
